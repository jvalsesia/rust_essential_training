    // Stack and heap memory
    // Stack: boxes of different sizes
    // - Values stored in sequential order
    // - Data added and removed as Last In, First Out (LIFO)
    // - Data can be pushed and popped very quickly
    // - All data must have a known, fixed size

    // Heap: shelves in wareshouse that store boxes of different sizes
    // - Adding and acessing data is slower that the Stack
    // - Dynamically add and remove data

    // Pointer: is a data type that stores memory address
    // Pointer is the inventory sheet that tells you where the specific box is stored in the shelf in the warehouse√ü
